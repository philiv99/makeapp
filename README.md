# MakeApp

> AI-Powered Feature Development Workflow Automation

MakeApp automates the end-to-end feature development workflow using GitHub Copilot. It handles branch management, captures feature requirements, orchestrates AI-driven code generation, and automates git operations including pull request creation.

## What It Does

- **Manages repositories and branches** — Scans and selects repositories, creates or switches feature branches
- **Captures feature requirements** — Defines features interactively, via files, or through an API
- **Configures AI context** — Auto-generates Copilot instructions and MCP configurations
- **Orchestrates AI code generation** — Executes GitHub Copilot with iterative planning and memory
- **Automates git workflows** — Stages, commits, pushes, and creates pull requests automatically

Available as both a PowerShell CLI and REST API.
